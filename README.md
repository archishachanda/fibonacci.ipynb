The Fibonacci sequence is a pretty famous sequence of integer numbers. The sequence comes up naturally in many problems and has a nice recursive definition. Learning how to generate it is an essential step in the pragmatic programmerâ€™s journey toward mastering recursion.

To print the Fibonacci sequence in Python, we need to generate a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The Fibonacci sequence follows a specific pattern that begins with 0 and 1, and every subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as: <br>
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)<br>

Where:<br>
F(0) = 0<br>
F(1) = 1<br>
F(n) for n > 1 is the sum of the two preceding numbers<br>

The sequence looks like this: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
